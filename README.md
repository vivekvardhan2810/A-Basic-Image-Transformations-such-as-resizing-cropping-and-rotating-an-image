# A-Basic-Image-Transformations-such-as-resizing-cropping-and-rotating-an-image
<p> This is a Repository that enhances me to learn about image transformations and it techniques from the subject <b>Computer Vision</b> </p>
<p> 1. In this repository I had imported the libraries such as <b>numpy, cv2 (Opencv), matplotlib.</b></p>
<p> 2. Next, We will import the Image (like as shown in .ipynb document , i had imported bird2.jpg) and we Will be converting the image from BGR to RGB (BGR- Blue, Green, Red) and It will implement the image.</p>
