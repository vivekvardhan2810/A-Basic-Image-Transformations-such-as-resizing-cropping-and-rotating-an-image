# A-Basic-Image-Transformations-such-as-resizing-cropping-and-rotating-an-image
<p> This is a Repository that enhances me to learn about image transformations and it techniques from the subject <b>Computer Vision</b> </p>
<p> 1. In this repository I had imported the libraries such as <b>numpy, cv2 (Opencv), matplotlib.</b></p>
<p> 2. Next, We will import the Image (like as shown in .ipynb document , i had imported bird2.jpg) and we Will be converting the image from BGR to RGB (BGR- Blue, Green, Red) and It will implement the image.</p> 
<p> <b>Q1. How can OpenCV be used to perform basic image transformations such as resizing, cropping and rotation an image? (log/ power log/ negative transformation)</b></p>
<p><b> Solution:</b></p>
<p> 1. Resizing The Image.
<br>
    2. Cropping The Image.
</br>
    3. Rotating The Image.
<br>
    4. Applying log Transformation.
</br>    
    5. Applying Power law Transformation.
<br>
    6. Negative Transformation.
