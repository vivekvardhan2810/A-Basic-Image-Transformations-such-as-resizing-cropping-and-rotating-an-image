# A-Basic-Image-Transformations-such-as-resizing-cropping-and-rotating-an-image
<p> This is a Repository that enhances me to learn about image transformations and it techniques from the subject <b>Computer Vision</b> </p>
<p> 1. In this repository I had imported the libraries such as <b>numpy, cv2 (Opencv), matplotlib.</b></p>
<p> 2. Next, We will import the Image (like as shown in .ipynb document , i had imported bird2.jpg) and we Will be converting the image from BGR to RGB (BGR- Blue, Green, Red) and It will implement the image.</p> 
<p> <b>Q1. How can OpenCV be used to perform basic image transformations such as resizing, cropping and rotation an image? (log/ power log/ negative transformation)</b></p>
<p><b> Solution:</b></p>
<p> 1. Resizing The Image.
<br>
    2. Cropping The Image.
</br>
    3. Rotating The Image.
<br>
    4. Applying log Transformation.
</br>    
    5. Applying Power law Transformation.
<br>
    6. Negative Transformation.
</br></p>
<p><b>Q2. What are some popular OpenCV algorithms or techniques used for image filtering and noise reduction?(median filter/ morphological operations)</b></p>
<p><b>Solution:</b></p>
<p>Some popular OpenCV algorithms or techniques used for image filtering and noise reduction are</p>

<p>1.Using filters</p>
<ul>
    <li>convolution filter</li>
    <li>median filter</li>
    <li>gaussina filter</li>
</ul>
<p>2.Using morphological operations</p>
<ul>
    <li>Negative transformation</li>
    <li>log transformation</li>
    <li>power law transformation</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Q3. What are some common image enhancement techniques in OpenCV for adjusting image brightness and contrast to improve the overall appearance of an image?(ex: histogram equalizer)</b></p>
<p><b>Solution:</b></p>
<p>Histogram Equalization is an image processing technique used to adjust the contrast of an image by altering the image histogram. it is based on Probability distribution and cumulatiove distributive functions on the pixels of the image.</p>
<p><b>Q4. What are some techniques or filters in OpenCV for performing color enhancement and correction, such as adjusting color balance, saturation, or performing color grading operations?</b></p>
<p><b>Solution:</b></p>
<p>Some technique or filters in OpenCV for performing color enhancement and correction, such as adjusting color ablance, saturation, or performing color grading operations are :- </p>
<ul>
    <li>Median filter - It is very effective in removing salt and pepper noise from an image.</li>
    <li>Gaussian filter - These are linear filters that reduce the noise and blur the edges effectively.</li>
    <li>Histogram equaltization</li>
    <li></li>
    <li></li>
</ul>
